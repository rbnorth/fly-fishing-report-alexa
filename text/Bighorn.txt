Fishing Coditions for the Bighorn.

Even though the flows on the Bighorn are at a historically low level, the fishing has been phenomenal.  We’re seeing fish starting to move up into some of the faster shelves as water temperatures start to warm up. We are also seeing an abundance of PMD nymphs...hint hint.  There are a handful of PMD adults around and a decent number of large Baetis as well.  I’m guessing another week or so and we should have the start of some awesome Summer dry fly fishing. The nymphing game is the best way to get into fish these days.  Wade fishing has been pretty darn good throughout the entire river. There is still moss below 3 Mile, but the Summer grass is really starting to grow and help filter it out. Carpet Bugs, Red Bead Rays, Split Case PMD’s, Poxyback PMD’s, Fold-over PMD's, Tungteasers, rainbow sowbugs, perdigons, and Black Quills are the only nymphs you need right now.
