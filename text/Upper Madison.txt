Fishing Coditions for the Upper Madison.

Hoot Owl restricitons have gone into place the entire reach of the Madison River, from the mouth to the boundary with Yellowstone National Park.  There have been Nocturnal Stone sightings, therefore, fishing those with a Caddis in the early mornings and evenings has been very productive. In the afternoons, the Hopper- Dropper rig is the hot ticket! For droppers, anything small and flashy will get the job done: Split-case pmd's, Green Machines, $3 dips, purple deaths, worms, shop vacs, black & brown rubber legs, and your favorite caddis pupa are all good bets. There have been some nice fish coming on the morning & evening streamer bite recently, cloudy days have been better overall.  Streamer color has been variable lately, but typically black and olive are great colors on cloudier and rainy days and yellow and white are our favorites for those sunny days.
