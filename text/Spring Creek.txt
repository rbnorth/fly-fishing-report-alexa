Fishing Coditions for the Spring Creek.

This is a wonderful time of year to be on the spring creeks. If you can get a calm cloudy day, the dry fly fishing has been excellent. Depending on the day/weather, you can see midges, caddis and terrestrial fishing will be your best bet with the warm weather.  As far as nymphing goes, things are fishing well. Midge larva, scuds, sows, and worms will get you into fish. As always, a stealthy approach and a good cast are important to finding a few fish.
