Fishing Coditions for the Big Hole.

The Big Hole is starting to slow down a bit, and Hoot Owl restrictions and full closures have gone into place.  A full fishing closure is in effect from the confluence with the Beaverhead River to Tony Schoonen Fishing Acess site, as well as from the Headwaters at Saginaw Bridge on Skinner Meadow Road the the North Fork.  Hoot Owl restrictions are in effect from the North Fork to Dickie Bridge, and from Maiden Rock to Tony Schoonen Fishing Access.   A combination of low water flows and hot temps have been stressing these fish out a bit. The best fishing will be in the morning with good pmds coming off until about noon. We have also been getting them good on a chubby dropper rig.
