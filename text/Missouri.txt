Fishing Coditions for the Missouri.

Hoot Owl restrictions have been put in place on the MO, portions include Town of Cascade Boat Ramp to Holter Dam.  The MO fish are starting to transition into faster water due to the rising water temps. Flows are low at 3370cfs. The PMD hatch is on, and terresterial season is just starting. For terresterials, try a black or cinnamon ant and/or a black beetle right tight to the bank. Hoppers will start to make an appearance in the next week or two. The trico's have showing up in great numbers as well. For those trico's, early morning...very early in the morning is the best time to target those rising fish.The nymph bite has been good in most stretches with sunken trico's, sunken ants, PMDs, caddis and the usuals which are sow bugs, scuds, worms, midges and small flashy mayfly patterns like craven's two bit hooker. A good nymphing combo is a rainbow tailwater sow bug with a green machine, splitcase PMD or a fold-over pmd trailed behind it. You can get a bite all day long with the nymphs. Make sure that if you're hitting some of the holes,use a long leader and quite a bit of weight since some of those eddies get pretty darn deep. If you can, try to stay in stretches like dam to Craig and/or wolf creek bridge to Craig since the water will be colder the higher up you go.
