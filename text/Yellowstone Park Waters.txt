Fishing Coditions for the Yellowstone Park Waters.

 Water temps are doing well inside the Park. The Lamar has Goldens and Sally's flying in the afternoon. All of its tributaries will also have them. The upper Yellowstone river above Canyon will open on the 15th. The Salmon flies ran up this reach a week ago but you will probably still get eats if you put on your line. This area will also have the Goldenstones and Sally's hatching. This part of the river gets a Drake hatch and they also hatch on Yellowstone Lake. The Madison early in the day and then again in the evenings is the best fishing on the west side of the Park. Caddis is the bug for the morning and evening dry fly fishing.
