Fishing Coditions for the Gallatin.

 From 4 Corners bridge downstream to the Missouri headwaters the Gallatin has a full fishing closure and the East Gallatin has an all day closure from Penwell bridge downstream to the confluence with the Gallatin. The canyon up into Yellowstone Park still has good water conditions. Lots of oxygen is created for the fish in the riffles above Big Sky and down the through the rapids in the canyon. Flying ants are beginning to be seen flying and a few of the first Spruce Moths are coming out of the forest.
