Fishing Coditions for the Yellowstone.

Yellowstone has gone on Hoot Owl fishing restrictions from the Park Boundary to the bridge in Laurel,  fishing is prohibited 2pm to midnight.  The very first signs of hopper/terrestrial fishing are here. Some fish are still swiping but if you have the right hopper fly there are some nice fish already looking for them. Yellow or light pink seem to be two colors the fish have been most interested in eating. Running a dropper has been effective to get into fish between dry fly eats. The high sun can definitely change the dry fly bite but smoky day are giving fake cloud cover. Some fish are keyed on a short dropper imitating an emerger. Some fish are hugging bottom and the best way to get into them is a full nymph rig. Sally and PMD nymphs are getting steady eats.
