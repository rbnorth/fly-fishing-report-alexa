Fishing Coditions for the Boulder.

If you head this way, try fishing above McCloud as flows and temps will be more favorable up that way.  Yellow sallies, caddis, pmds, and stimulators should do the trick on the surface.  Hopper season has started!  If nothing is happening on the surface try some soft hackle mayflies.
