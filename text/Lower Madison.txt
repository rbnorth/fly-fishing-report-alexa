Fishing Coditions for the Lower Madison.

The lower is currently under hoot owl restrictions. Technically the river will be open to fishing from midnight till 2:00 P.M. With low flows and extremly hot temps, its probaly best to leave this river alone till things cool down in september. If you do decide to fish the lower, go very early in the morning, use barbless hooks, get your fish in as soon as possible, and do not take your fish out of the water as this exponentially increases mortality.
